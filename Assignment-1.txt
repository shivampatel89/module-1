1) What is software?

--> Software is a set of instructions, data or programs used to operate computers and execute specific tasks.

2) What is software engineering? 

--> Software Engineering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software. Software engineering includes a variety of techniques, tools, and methodologies,including requirements analysis, design, testing, and maintenance.
   
3)Explain types of software.

--> The two main categories of software are application software and system software. 

i)system s/w hardware (webcam drivers) -->System software is designed to run a computer's hardware and provides a platform for applications to run on top of.

ii)programming s/w -->Compiler: A compiler translates code from a high-level programming language into machine code before the program runs. 
		     Interpreter: An interpreter translates code written in a high-level programming language into machine code line-by-line as                     the code runs.

iii)web applications -->A web application is software that runs in your web browser which runs over internet.

4)What is SDLC? Explain each phase of SDLC.

--> SDLC is Software Development Life Cycle.
    There are majorly six phases.
    i)Requirment (static/dynamic)
   ii)Analysis
  iii)Designing
   iv)Coding/implement
    v)Testing
   vi)Maintainance
